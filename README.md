This is not proxying to my knowledge?

This project was written in both JS and TS with the React starter template from Vite. Either way it is possible to create something like this just requires a little bit of setup and some screwing around with rollup and vite configs for which files to write/bundle, and the correct plugins to use to parse the language.
